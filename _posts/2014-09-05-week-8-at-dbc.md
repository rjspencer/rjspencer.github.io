title: Week 8 at Dev Bootcamp
---

IT IS THE LAST WEEK!  I made it to the end.  So exciting.  Its been a long journey but I feel very prepared for what comes next.  

I can't believe how much my brain has grown in the last 8 weeks.  Things come out of my fingers and computers do stuff.  Its magic.

My biggest regret is that I live so far away.  I have over an hour commute each way and much of that is wasted.  It gives me a chance to think through ideas and decompress, but it is just too much time.  I can't bring myself to waste that 2+ hours on the weekends, so I don't come in.  I would love to be here with everyone else, but it is better to spend that time with my wife and kids.  

The instructors here have been great.  They put themselves at our level, are always approachable, and seem genuinely concerned with our success.  

If I could change 1 thing about week 8's structure, I would move pitches to the beginning of the day.  Waiting around till 2:30pm to find out was nerve wracking.  I was so anxious to get started.
