  <h3>Making Mobile Apps with Ruby</h3>
  <em>Yes, you can put it on Rails or make it light and smooth with Sinatra</em>
  It used to be that if you wanted to make a smartphone app you needed to code in Objective C for iPhones and Java for Android phones.  Today, there are new options for Rubyists to create apps.
  <h4>Android - JRuby + Ruboto</h4>
  <p><a href="http://jruby.org/" target="_blank"><b>JRuby</b></a> allows Ruby to be compiled using the Java compiler.  Ruby code can actually run much faster this way as JRuby can take advantage of Java benefits like multi-threading.  JRuby works anywhere Java does.</p>

  <p><a href="http://ruboto.org/" target="_blank"><b>Ruboto</b></a> is a framework specializing in creating Android apps.  You don't actually need it, but the Ruboto team has already done a lot of work linking in to commonly used Android resources.  You can build parts of your app via the command line like in Rails.

  <h4>iOS - MacRuby + RubyMotion</h4>
  <p><b>MacRuby</b> is Apple's implementation of Ruby.  All Mac computers ship with MacRuby installed. </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/" target="_blank"><b>RubyMotion</b></a> brings Ruby code to iOS devices. Thanks to RubyMotion, ruby apps compile natively and run about as fast as if they were written in Objective C</p>
