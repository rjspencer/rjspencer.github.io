title: Week 2 at Dev Bootcamp
---

This week we tackled classes, modules, and separation of concerns.  I nailed it.  I am very comfortable with the subject matter of this week.  By the end, the instructors had very little to improve upon.  My timed 3 hour assesment had a (very low level) GUI and the only comment was that I used the Array.each method instead of the Enumerable.find method.  The find method uses the each method, so it actually is the exact same as what I wrote, but the code would have looked a little cleaner.  I probably would have gotten to it if I had more time.

Personally

I have spent a lot of time this week teaching others.  I am struggling with finding the balance between teaching and learning.  I find teaching to be a great way to solidify my learning but the law of dimishing returns kicks in pretty quick.  I can still learning from teaching the same thing over and over, but I feel I should be challenging myself with new opportunities.

I may have to switch from earbud to headphones because people have been interupting me with questions while I try to code on my own.  I thought the <b>2 ears in, do not interrupt</b> thing was universally accepted in the tech world.
