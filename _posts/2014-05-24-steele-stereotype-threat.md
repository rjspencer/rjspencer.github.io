title: Steele's Stereotype Threat
---

Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority underachievement and developed a theory called "Stereotype Threat." Conduct your own research about stereotype threat. Identify times when you felt it. How did it affect your achievement? What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically?

Claude M. Steele's "Stereotype Threat" is just a fancy way of saying your self image is a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Asian people are good at math.  Black people are good at sports.  White men can't jump.

If you buy into the things people say about you, you will perform accordingly.  

Steele claims that black people perform poorly on tests because they believe they are less intelligent.  

In my experience as a high school teacher in a mostly white suburban Indiana area, the minority students often try to live up to the stereotypes.  One-on-one with me, they are just like everyone else.  Sure, they may have interests that are a bit stereotypical, like the black guys playing basketball and collecting expensive shoes.  But, as far as intelligence, life-experiences, emotional maturity, I have never seen any real difference between races.  Have I seen performance differences?  Yes. 

I'm don't completely agree with Steele.  Yes, a black student may score poorly on an intelligence test because stereotypes have caused him to believe that he should score lower than the white students.  My problem with Steele is that he seems to want us to stop stereotyping.  That is never going to happen.  

Humans didn't invent stereotypes, Mother Nature did. Clown fish avoid barracudas.  Sparrows stay away from hawks.  Mice instictually know that snakes are bad news.  Lets look at this conversation between 2 cave men...

"Hey look, a bear!  Let's pet it."
"Stay back!  I hear those things are terrible drivers."

As you can see, animals simplify the world around them with stereotypes.  It keeps them alive.

You could certainly argue that in a civilized world, there is no need for stereotypes.  Sure, but we are still animals.  

So my point is, stereotypes are not going away.  We need to teach kids to be confident in their skin, no matter what color it is.

How have stereotypes affected me?  I am a tall, white, middle-class, white male.  The world is my oyster.  I believe that my stereotype challenge has been living up to the hype.  I should be unstoppable, and all that pressure caused me to avoid big risks earlier in my life.  
I guess my point is that Steele makes it sound like white people keep telling everyone else they are stupid and that is causing minorities to perform poorly and I think that makes us weak.  We need to be taught to believe in ourselves, to overcome with positive thoughts, and to seek our dreams.

Steele would have us fight to eliminate racism.  I would rather encourage positive thoughts and teach students to visualize their goals.
