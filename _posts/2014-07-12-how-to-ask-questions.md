# How to Ask Questions
It seems like a silly statement, you've been asking questions your whole life.  Are you sure you have been asking them the right way?

## Have a Goal 
What kind of answer do you want? 

Yes or no answers can save time.  "Is Jimmy John's ok for lunch?" is a perfectly good question if you don't want to have a long discussion.  This type of question assumes an answer, and most people will go along with it unless they feel very strongly the other way.  

Either/Or questions limit responses, but that might be ok.  "Should we move forward with project A or B?" is a valid question if there are no other real options.  For example, someone may have a great project C idea, but management says you have already spent your R&D budget and you must move forward tomorrow with A or B.  

Who, what, when, where, and why will elicit deeper answers.  "Who do you think should tackle project x?" or "What do you think we can do to improve productivity?" are questions that can expand your horizons and give you answers you likely had not considered.

## Know Your Audience 
Tailor your question to your audience and show them respect.  

If you are asking a coding question on an online forum like StackExchange.com, ask straightforward and specific questions.  They specifically state that they are not a place to get opinions, so don't ask for one.  There are plenty of other places on the internet for that.  If you have a code question, be sure to give plenty of background on what you are trying to do, but also be sure you limit your question to one goal.  Avoid tucking 3 or 4 questions into one.

Speak at your audience's level as best you can.

Ask questions they can answer.  If they are in a rush, switch to yes/nos.  If they can't answer a question, don't ask it (like asking HR for someone's phone number).

If you are talking to kindergarten kids, don't ask them about algebra.

## Google 
Everyone can Google, and they expect you to be able to do the same.  If you are asking how to do something, step 1 should always be an online search.  You may find your answer faster.  If you can't find an answer, then ask someone else.  Tell them that you tried but you only found pictures of cats.

## Be Clear and Concise 
You can give background information about your situation, but make sure your audience understands your goal.  Break your question down to a single clear sentence and repeat it.  Starting your conversation with the question, then adding background, and finish with the same question.  You can also rephrase your question, but be careful to ask the same question.

## Follow, Don't Lead 
People hate empty air.  You may feel tempted to continue talking after you ask your question if you don't get an answer right away.  Don't.  Allow your respondant to think and provide a good answer.  Don't interrupt them unless they stray too far from the question (you may need to clearly and concisely rephrase the question).  Once they have finished talking, keep quiet.  Evaluate what they said.  They also hate the empty air and may add more to the answer.  After you take a long moment to evaluate the answer, ask for an clarification if you need it or summarize and rephrase the answer to confirm your understanding.

## Tell Me More 
"That's great, tell me more." followed by silence is one of the most powerful actions in the world.  Try it at a party, you can go the whole night with little more than that phrase.

## Respect the Responder 
Most people are good and helpful.  Almost all.  Bring this attitude with you when asking questions.  If you have the wrong attitude, an answer may offend you.  The responder may not know you well and explain how to do something like you are an ignorant fool and not answer your question with enough detail.  Don't get mad, clarify your question.
