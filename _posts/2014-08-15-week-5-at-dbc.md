I stumbled on some ActiveRecord syntax.  I feel I could have done the assessment in raw SQL without an issue.  I'm disappointed in myself, but I'm confident that I will be able to move on to phase 3.

I showed up late on Monday and Tuesday.  I had some stuff I had to deal with so sleep and leaving early didn't mesh.  Traffic made it worse.  I know I can do better and I need to clear out those distractions so I can push through the last 4 weeks strongly.

I need to nail down my AR syntax this weekend.  I'm great at front-end work, and will likely end up in UI/UX, but I want to be strong with the whole stack.  I need to make sure I don't checkout on back-end work during these upcoming big projects.

I'm excited that we are halfway through, and I really look forward to making an awesome final project.  I love being apart of this awesome group, yet I am also a father and need the world to settle down.  Its a fun line to walk, I'll miss it when we are done.
