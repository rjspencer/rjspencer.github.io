# Week 1 at Dev Bootcamp

Friday!  Week one is almost complete.  I can't believe it.

We focused on Ruby this week, and will for the next 2 week.  I've learned to manipulate strings, deal with arrays, and build hashes.  I made a game in that runs in the terminal.  Now I have so many ideas for things to do on my free time, if I had any.

Thursday was a big day for me.  I did not finish all the challenges, but concepts were really coming together in my head.  I did extra work on some of the challenges, including extracting code into separate methods and modifying them into generic, reusable code blocks.  I am going to look into creating a gemfile with that code during lunch, bonus points.

Every day is an hour plus commute here and back, but I do it so I can see my kids everyday.  I start the day making a breakfast of scrambled eggs for my family and I give them all a kiss at night.  As hard as all this is, at least I everyday starts and ends on a high note.
