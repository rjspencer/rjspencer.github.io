**LINUX**

I find Ubuntu, Windows 8 and Mac OSX all to be too pretty and I think it hurts their functionality.  I spend most of my time in programs, not navigating the OS so I don't need pretty icons, transitions, and all that other fancy stuff that makes the computer run slower.

Ubuntu with a lighter, faster interface (xfce4).  You can also add the Xfce gui to any Linux distro with sudo apt-get install xfce4.

Ubuntu based, but better.  Nearly everything you need is already installed.  The interface is more classic, a bit like Windows XP but more modern.  It is still heavier the Xfce used in Xubuntu but I think a lot of new Linux users will prefer to get their feet wet in Linux with Mint.  Since Mint is Ubuntu based, most online Ubuntu tips & how-tos will work the same.  

*Guake* - Neat quick terminal popup tied to F12.  Had some issues where certain command would not work.  Could have fixed, but found that Xfce has a similiar functionality built-in.

*Xfce Popup Terminal*  I like to set mine to F12  - Right-align, 100% Height, and 33% width.  With wide screens, it works well and the heigth gives me extra lines to see code returns.

*Word Wrap*
	Preferences >> Settings - User ---- 
	Add: "word_wrap": "auto",
	You cannot change the Default settings, but you can view them.  Anything you want to change, just copy over to the User file and adjust.  When the program loads the settings cascade like CSS where the Default document goes first and then the User document overrides.
