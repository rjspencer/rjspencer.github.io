title: Week 4 at Dev Bootcamp
---

I was spoiled last week.  I was pushed.  I learned a ton and felt like I contributed to their learning as well.  This week did not go as well.  Not very well at all.  

I felt like I was the strongest one in my group and that can be draining to spend the whole time teaching.  I'm sure others have felt the same way about me at some point during DBC.  

My group sat by the window and I think that was a big mistake.  If I was near other groups, that could have pushed me.  I will position myself better in the future.  

Overall, this week was very frustrating for me.  This week should have been a good week.  These topics are in my wheelhouse.  I have a strong grasp of the concepts, I tripped up mostly on implementation.  I went down rabbit holes and no one was there to pull me out.  I over thought problems and spent too long finding solutions.  

There was a personal issue that has been weighing on me too that added to the stress, thankfully that will be resolved be the end of the weekend and I can focus 100% again.

I am jealous of those that live close and can spend more time at DBC.  It is hard to compete with that.  I would never trade my family for that freedom, but I can still be a bit envious.
