  <h3>The Day They Thought I Was Going To Die.</h3>
  <p>I went to my doctor's office at 2:30pm and by 11:00pm I was having my burst appendix removed in an emergency surgery.<p>
  <p>The hardest part for me to deal with is knowing that my wife had to listen to me scream.  She had to be thinking that she might end up a widow just 2 weeks after giving birth to our second child.</p>
  <p>Mistakes were made at the hospital.  I was in the ER and someone came and said my room was ready on teh surgery floor.  I could barely hear her over my gut-wrenching pain, but I assumed this was a good thing going to the surgery floor.  It turns out they don't do surgery on the surgery floor.  In fact, there wasn't even a doctor there.  I waited a very-long time for pain-medication.  They NEVER should have moved me in such an unstable condition out of the ER.</p>
  <p>Then my mother and sister <em>(both employed by other hospitals)</em> arrived and raised HELL until I got my much need operation</p>
  <p>It has been almost a month and I am recovering quite well.  I still have a bit of stamina to regain, but I'm back to do everything I was doing before.<p>
  <br>
  <p>I have been encouraged to meet with a lawyer about my ordeal.  However, I have a plan for this year.  It doesn't involve spending time going through legal documents.  I enrolled in Dev Bootcamp to change careers and accelerate my life.  I feel that time spent on a lawsuit is time wasted on the past.  I don't want to win money, I want to earn it.  If I was injured to the point where I couldn't work, it would be a different story.  </p>
  <p>Am I just avoiding the confrontation?  Maybe.  Would I feel shameful to be the plaintiff in a malpractice suit?  Yes I think I would.  I guess I will be buried in Dev Bootcamp work very soon.  Maybe I can avoid it till fall.</p>
  <p><em>p.s. Morphine is awful.  I didn't want to close my eyes.</em></p>
