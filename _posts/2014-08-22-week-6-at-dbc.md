title: Week 6 at Dev Bootcamp
---

I made it.  I did poorly on the assesment, but Nate believes in me, and that feels good.  No matter what I will be done with Dev Bootcamp in 3 more weeks.  I have learned and grown.  I am so excited to become a real developer.  

There a plenty of stresses coming.  I received my last paycheck and my wife starts back at work on Monday.  Money will be tight until I land a job, but I am confident in my ability.  I got rid of the old job/yearbook stressor that was messing with my head this phase and I know I can ignore the rest to finish strong.

I am learning Angular in addition to the cores.  I will continue to push myself harder and harder.  I will be great at this.  I am one of the best front-end devs in our group. 

In 3 weeks, I will graduate.  I am excited to see the presentations of the current grads, but I am far more interested in working hard today to conquer Angular.
