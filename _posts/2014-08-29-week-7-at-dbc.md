Rails!  I wrote a presentation in rails instead of powerpoint.  I think that is a huge testament to both the power of Rails and the power of DBC.

I wish I could spend more time on this project instead of the testing challenges.  The testing challenges are probably good to force us to learning testing.  I wonder what would happen if, instead of lectures and challenges, instructors spent 30 minutes with each group writing tests for our specific projects.

I'm excited to see the end.  I'll miss being apart of such an awesome group.  I thought after high school that I would never be part of such a social structure again, and now I am apart of the coolest, friendliest, most supportive crew that I could have ever imagined.  It is amazing.
