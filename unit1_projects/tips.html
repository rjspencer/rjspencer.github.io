<h3>Command Line</h3>
<h4>Using the * Wildcard</h4>
<p>You can use the * asterisk symbol as a wildcard character in your commands.  The obvious reason to use a wildcard is when you only know part of what you are looking for, but you can also use it as a speed up.  Instead of typing <em>cd annual_reports_2014</em> you can just type <em>cd *14</em> if you know it is the only folder that ends with 14.  You can use this trick with files and folders and even during program calls like <em>ruby 2*</em> or <em>sqlite3</em> *cat. </p>
